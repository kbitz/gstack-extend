### Failed-ledger retry with non-semver NEW aborts the helper

**What:** Do not call `version_gt` / `semver_lte` unless NEW is semver. If NEW is `unknown` (or any letter-bearing string), skip the compare and either retry every failed name or leave them queued.

**Why:** After 15B, the window skip refuses non-semver OLD/NEW, then the failed-ledger path still calls `semver_lte VER unknown`. Under `set -u`, `(( 1 > unknown ))` is unbound and the EXIT trap kills the helper before the retry runs.

**Context:** Red-team finding after v0.24.5.0 landed (PR #96). Reproduced: `bash -c 'set -u; bi=unknown; (( 1 > bi ))'`. File: `bin/lib/run-migrations.sh` failed-path `semver_lte`. No production `migrations/v*.sh` yet — fix before the first real script.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None
**Completed:** v0.24.6.0 (2026-08-15)

### Setup-fail after pull drops in-window migrations forever

**What:** Persist the pre-pull version (or pre-register in-window names into `migrations-failed`) before `./setup`. A later `update-run` must still see those names when OLD==NEW.

**Why:** Pull advances VERSION, then setup can exit 1 (`no bun`, install-safety). The helper never runs. Next hop reads OLD==NEW, so unstarted in-window scripts are not in the failed ledger and never execute. Same hole if the helper aborts mid-scan.

**Context:** Red-team finding after v0.24.5.0. Not the deferred first-hop chicken-and-egg (old binary missing the call site). This is every post-15B hop whose helper does not finish after VERSION already moved. `bin/update-run` setup is ~line 122; helper only runs if setup returned.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P1
**Depends on:** None
**Completed:** v0.24.6.0 (2026-08-15)

### Helper-path tests before the first real `v*.sh`

**What:** Add fixtures for: helper missing-args / missing semver.sh / bad-version; empty `migrations/` (`.gitkeep` only); symlink and non-semver name skip; fail-then-succeed clears `migrations-failed`; unexpected helper abort emits `MIGRATION_WARN helper`.

**Why:** Post-ship coverage audit scored 69% on the 15B hook. Those branches are how the two P1 holes hide. Tests should exist before any install-mutating script ships.

**Context:** Coverage audit after PR #96. Do not file each gap as its own item. Bundle lives here; implement with the P1 fixes.

**Effort:** S
**Priority:** P2
**Depends on:** The two P1 upgrade items above (same PR is fine)
**Completed:** v0.24.6.0 (2026-08-15)
